# Container Number Extractor (CNE)
The **Container Number Extractor (CNE)** is used to extract all the container details (door) into structured JSON format. Here we uses **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** technology and **Google's Gemini API key** to extract the details from the container and then give the output in **Structured JSON** format.
