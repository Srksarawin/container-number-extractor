# Container Number Extractor (CNE)
The **Container Number Extractor (CNE)** is used to extract all the container details (door) into structured JSON format.<br> It uses  **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** technology to extract the details from the container and then give the output in **Structured JSON** format. Here we use **Google's Gemini API key** to give the output in **Structured JSON** format and also to make the extraction process in simpler steps.
